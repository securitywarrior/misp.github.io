- Removed an accidentally added edit button. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue that incorrectly reported a feed update to have failed
  when not using delta-merge mode. [Iglocska]

  - the issue was that in the case of a feed update to a fixed event without delta merge, MISP tried to insert all parsed attributes, which correctly automatically blocked duplicates
  - however, since these attributes were blocked by the validator, the feed fetcher reported that the fetch didn't succeed as it contained validation errors

  - this fix simply runs non-delta merge mode updates through the comparisons to the existing event, removing duplicates in advance
- Fixed an issue that prevented the feeds from working in CSV mode if no
  value field was set. [Iglocska]
- Removed invalid entry in writeable file diagnostics. [Iglocska]

  [Andras Iklody]

  Performance improvements, bug fixes and new features for the export to Bro
- - Performance improvements when exporting a large number of attributes
  into Bro format. - Fixed file header formatting for the export to Bro
  format (tabs used consistently). - Computing the time needed for
  generating the export to Bro format when done using a background job.
  - When generating the Bro export from the UI all the attributes are
  generated in one single text file similar to the CSV export instead of
  a zip file with different files inside. - Changed the file extension
  of Bro export files from ".intel" to ".txt". - Removed the allowNonIDS
  option from the Bro export as it doesn’t make sense to have it (Bro is
  an IDS). - Fixed some of the API endpoints which were not accepted
  (ACL issues). - Added support for a list of events that should be /
  should not be included in the export. - Added a new "meta.desc" column
  (added in Bro 2.5, see
  https://www.bro.org/sphinx/frameworks/intel.html) containing the
  description of the event and of the attribute. - Sanitized the
  exported data for Bro. - Fixed a number of value substitutions which
  were imported from Snort/Suricata and which were not working for Bro.
  Did instead substitutions needed for Bro. [Liviu Valsan]

Fix
~~~

  [Iglocska]
- Removed already removed file that got reverted. [Iglocska]

  - As first committed by @rotanid
  - The file is not used any longer, however removing it causes issues unless we clean the model cache

  - fixed
- Fixed the incorrect column order on the event index. [Iglocska]

  displaying. [Iglocska]

- Use php5-redis package instead of pecl for deb7/ubu14. [Andreas
  Ziegler]
- Submodule updates: force overwrite. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Several fixes to the sharing group behavious. [Iglocska]

  - New setting roaming:
    - Until now, users could unselect "Limit instances to which data in this sharing group should be pushed to"
    - This lead to no servers added to the distribution list, and MISP would simply determine, based on the sync rules, whether the host organisation of the remote instance is eligible for the event
    - This works well in most cases, but in some cases, the local instance is not kept after a sync (aliases for the local instance baseurl vs remote instance's view of the url)
    - In these cases the sharing groups ended up being "unlimited", which was not the intent
    - Generally this shouldn't cause any issues as MISP still requires the sync link's organisation to be directly contained in an SG before it would push the event further
    - However, introducing the roaming setting this can be more clearly defined
    - By default, sharing groups are set to non roaming

  - Some further fixes to the sharing group update procedure for 2.4.49

  - Update the roaming status of existing sharing groups. Local sharing groups with no instances attached will become roaming by default, all others are assumed to be non-roaming
- Add own org of sync user to the Sharing group if the sync user is in
  no way contained in the sharing group. [Iglocska]

  - This situation should normally only occur during a pull when the remote end has a sharing group that allows access for all local orgs
- Progress on the sharing group fix for pulled server based sharing
  groups. [Iglocska]
- Cleanup of some messy function call parameters. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue where a MISP.org setting with non alphanumeric
  characters could lead to invalid STIX document generation. [Iglocska]
- Added taxonomies/delete to the ACL component. [Iglocska]
- Added functionality to remove taxonomies, fixes #1365. [Iglocska]
- Allow null values for taxonomies expanded column, fixes #1354.
  [Andreas Ziegler]
- Tightened lookups for the addTag / removeTag APIs. [Iglocska]

  - no longer a substring match, users have to specify the full tag name
- Add perm_delegate to MYSQL.sql. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Remove SET from sql ADD column statement. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Update mysql structure for 2.4.49 updates. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Specify correct&specific branches in .gitmodules. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Additional chars =~ in mail address regex. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Use different variable name in sub-loop. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Check for correct event uuid and id. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed an issue where an event view by a malformed UUID would result in
  a lookup against the leading numerical value in the malformed UUID,
  fixes #1338. [Iglocska]
- Add warninglist tables to MYSQL.sql. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Use same default value as in AppModel update mechanism. [Andreas
  Ziegler]
- Tag keywords in attribute search filter has issues with an empty
  newline, fixes #1330. [Iglocska]
- Fixed leading/trailing white spaces from breaking the quick filter on
  the event index, fixes #1329. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue with an invalid offset in a comparison when adding
  events. [Iglocska]
- Removed duplicate of the same condition. [Iglocska]
- Filtering on attributes in the event view gives a no attributes
  warning if a tab doesn't contain attributes. [Iglocska]

  - Warning now only triggers if the event doesn't have any attributes in any tabs
- Throw exception for malformed xml file. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Set default value for realFileName. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Throw exception if necessary config cant be read. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed two issues for API add event corner cases, fixes #1298.
  [Iglocska]

  - Correctly handle old style creator org fields ("orgc":orgc_string)
  - Correctly handle new tags with no colour set
- Follow up to the previous patch, same thing for log searches.
  [Iglocska]
- Move case statement and add break. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed an issue with org admins having too much access via the logs.
  [Iglocska]
- Organisations updated with no changes cause erroneous log entries,
  fixes #1099. [Iglocska]
- Allow the export of an empty event in MISP JSON/XML format, fixes
  #1295. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue that caused MISP's capture org to disambiguate on the
  name instead of the UUID in some cases. [Iglocska]

  - Due to a fallback mechanism the disambiguation happened on the name if there was no UUID match during the saving of an event instead of creating a new organisation. This was an issue if a remote org changed UUID for example.
- Added domain|ip to the OpenIOC export. [Iglocska]

  - also, the new system should be much easier to extend with new mapping options and is generally a lot cleaner.
  - It would be more complete if Airbus wouldn't have skimped on power outlets on the A380s....
- Rework of the IOC export component, fixes #1292. [Iglocska]
- Ambiguous order field fixed, fixes REST sort of index. Fixes #1266.
  [Iglocska]

  - Fixes an issue where viewing the index of an instance remotely returns no events if sorted on a field.
  - This was caused by some ambiguous field names (such as ID)
  - Fixed by prepending the sorted field name by "Event."
- Fixed an issue with the attribute search incorrectly showing org

  Casting the sharing_group_id to int value
- Throw exception for sharing group if unauthorised user. [I-am-
  Sherlocked]

  Instead of returning a false value for sharing_group_id, throw an exception if user is not authorised to save modifications to that sharing group.
- Fixing the error caused by a false sharing_group_id. [I-am-Sherlocked]

  If SharingGroup->captureSG returned false indicating it did not save the sharing group, then distribution should be set to 0, and the sharing_group_id to an integer 0.
- Casting the sharing_group_id to int value. [I-am-Sherlocked]

  Saving the sharing_group_id as it is returned by CaptureSG results in Error: [PDOException] SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1366 Incorrect integer value: '' for column 'sharing_group_id' at row 1. Wrapping it in intval will insert the correct int value.

  Allow empty events in pull since they are pushed and importable
- Allow empty events in pull since they are pushed and importable.
  [Steve Fossen]

  Pulling events from a MISP instance didn't match the events imported from that same MISP instance export, nor did it match events published onto that MISP instance and viewable.

  Events without attributes:
      1) can be pushed
      2) imported
      3) exported

  This fix allows them to be pulled to allow consistency with all other actions.

- Don't query every event for proposals, when you don't have permission

  A little hacky, but without correct permission, the returning null causes the else case ( Fallback for < 2.4.7 instances )  which then queries every event, for proposals which it doesn't have permission for, so wastes resources on both side.

  - better handling of arrays returned, can still use improvements
- Organisation filter field was case sensitive. Fixed. [Iglocska]

    - taggers can tag events with existing tags
    - tag editors can create / edit / delete tags

    - this was enforced before but the UI elements were present and threw errors

  - Migration is automatic
    - all existing tagger roles will automatically become tag editors
    - restricting current roles takes manual admin action, but the functionality should remain unchanged for those that just update
- Case insensitive tagname lookup for the addtag / removetag APIs.

v2.4.31 (2016-03-30)
--------------------
- Fix to an issue with the password reset breaking the credentials.
  [Iglocska]

  - The password change forced on users by administrators couldn't save new passwords
  - instead it reset the password to a new random password

  - Resetting the password of such users via the admin interface should fix the issue
  - Alternatively manually setting the password also fixes it
- Re-enabled the missing poporvers on relations. [Iglocska]
- Fixed some issues with the hover enrichment modules. [Iglocska]
- Some refactoring of the freetext tool. [Iglocska]
- Handling of the "freetext" return format via the enrichment modules,
  and error handling fixed. [Iglocska]

  - still a lot of improvements to be done for the detection mechanism

  - error handling for modules, instead of discarding errors they are now shown as a flash message on the freetext import result screen
- Unpublish event if the published flag is not set during an edit.
  [Iglocska]

v2.4.25 (2016-03-09)
--------------------
- Scheduled push incorrectly used the user e-mail address instead of a
  user object to initiate the sync, fixes #1000. [Iglocska]


v2.4.24 (2016-03-07)
--------------------
- Version bump. [Iglocska]
- Better feedback on the sync connection test. [Iglocska]

  - sync users that have not accepted the terms / have had a password reset initiated were redirected to the login page

  - fixes to the issue
    - if a user with automation/sync access uses the API and gets blocked because the terms weren't accepted or there is a pending password change they will be notified in a JSON/XML response

  - Both instances have to be 2.4.24+ for this to be reported correctly

    - this will change the distribution to the sharing group with ID=5
    - Requirements: User has to have access to SG(5)

  - pull / push mechanism would still alert on proposal exchanges
- Merge branch '2.4' of https://github.com/MISP/MISP into 2.4.
  [Iglocska]
- MISP taxonomies updated to the latest version. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  - One of the GPG diagnostic checks could run if a previous prerequisite has already failed
- Slightly better error reporting for GPG diagnostic issues. [Iglocska]
- All events quick filter added to event index, fixes #950. [Iglocska]
- Event Tag numbering fixed. [Iglocska]

  - When fetching events, non exportable tags are blocked at a tag level
  - this results in some empty eventTags, which were correctly unset
  - however, this resulted in an associative array instead of an indexed one in the exports

  - fixed by reindexing the eventTags
- If a user is disabled then he should not receive mass admin e-mails.
  [Iglocska]

  - however, if an admin specifically chooses to e-mail him/her it will still work
- Fixed an issue that blocked the editing of attributes in unpublished
  events if the MISP.unpublishedprivate setting was set. [Iglocska]

  Ubuntu one. [Iglocska]
- Typo error with registrar fixed #984. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  #972. [Iglocska]

-------------------
- Rework of the contributor field, some MYSQL.sql tweaks. [iglocska]

  - added indeces to the MYSQL.sql file

-------------------
- Fixes a bug on invalid event IDs passed to the STIX export causing
  long execution times, fixes #747. [iglocska]

  - Running a stix export for a specific ID that doesn't exist results in a full STIX export for the user (events visible to the user)

v2.4.1 (2015-12-26)
-------------------
- Several fixes to the exports, fixes #790. [iglocska]

  - this should reduce very slow processing of large data sets
- Fixed a serious issue with the snort/suricata export which would keep
  appending all eligible attributes over and over to the file instead of
  properly fetching them event by event resulting in a massive export
  file. [iglocska]
- More graceful handling of pgp errors in the emailer. [iglocska]

  - until now the encryption of emails happened in a try catch block
  - however, crypt_gpg throws a fatal error instead of an exception, killing the background worker

  - added an extra checking algorithm that will test the key for a valid encryption key (encryption enabled + not expired)
  - if it's not there, it will just log an error message and continue execution of the other e-mails
- Event tags correctly saved on rest add if they are set in the
  compressed format (event->tag instead of event->eventtag->tag)
  [iglocska]
- When adding/editing a sync user, the choice to limit a user by
  instance settings shows empty lines for instances without a name.
  [iglocska]

  - use the URL in those cases instead
- Editing an event via REST would not capture the tags. [iglocska]

  - if a user is a tagger the tag should be created (if not existing on the current instance) and added to the event
- Merge branch '2.4' of https://github.com/MISP/MISP into 2.4.

  not getting an ID as expected. [Iglocska]

  - the saving would generate a 405
- Added some fixes to corner cases. [Iglocska]

  - publishing an event when push is enabled to a 2.3 instance failed with an error instead of blocking

  - Added mangle-sync towards 2.3
    - gracefully push non sharing group events in a 2.3 format

- Fix to logging causing certain functions to fail on migrated

  - It seems like relying on the Accept header can lead to the data type detection failing when accessing .json extension views
  - this issue seems to have gone unnoticed since until now the data passed to the json view was the same as that passed to the html view

- Set of changes to the sync. [Iglocska]

  - finished preview feature
    - can now view events and attributes remotely
    - can copy over new event to local instance

  - new sync mode (update)
    - allows to only pull changes to events that exist locally already

  - Fixed an issue with background tasks causing the logging to fail

  - reworked connection test showing version numbers of both instances
    - also telling the admin whether the sync is compatible or not

  - Further refactoring / tweaking of the vent view

  #502, fixes #499. [iglocska]

  - this commit is mostly here to capture what was changed in hotfix 2.3.69

  - e-mailing completely reworked, all e-mails now flow through the same method
  - that method will handle all encryption and the decisions whether to send e-mails unencrypted to users without an encryption key, whether to keep the body of the e-mail untruncated, etc
  - all e-mails are now also logged here (including the reason of a potential failure)

  - new server settings for default template messages for password resets / new user welcome messages

  - admin e-mail interface reworked and org admins now also have access to the features

- Blackhole message due to csrf replaced with something more obvious,
  fixes #504. [iglocska]

  - user will get an explanation of the csrf error and that going back and refreshing the form will fix it

- New emailer finished. [iglocska]
- Further progress. [iglocska]
- Rework of the e-mailing, part 1. [iglocska]

  - Reworking the way e-mails are sent - all of it goes through a centralised e-mail method
  - just pass the recipient, recipient encryption key collection, body, alternate body if the message cannot be encrypted, subject, reply to address and pgp key for reply to along and the method will do the rest

  - encrypt if possible, check if sending without encryption is allowed, signing, adding attachment for reply to encryption key, using alternate sanitised body if it is enforced for accounts that cannot use encryption is all done in one place

  - easy to maintain and expand with future changes (such as the S/MIME pull request on github)

  - issues left to fix:
  	- tag changes after an attribute change run into CSRF protection

  - during the event id pull, the local server already checks the timestamps, removing the ids of events that are not newer than the local version
  - this results in only the event metadata being pulled for all events, and the attributes of only those events that need to be updated are pulled resulting in much quicker pulls

  sha256, http-method, named-pipe and mutex added to the
  shadow attributes. Fixing #170

- Upgrade script for 2.1.8. [iglocska]

  - we have introduced the "locked" flag for events to protect events of the original creator from being edited by a sync user

  - IMPORTANT: before running the script below, make sure to create the locked field for the event table (see INSTALL/LOCKED.sql)

  - This script (generateLocked found in the Administrative tools menu) will attempt to set the locked value for existing events to ease the transition

  - The default value for locked is 0, and all events created on the instance should be set to this value

  - events that were synced from another instance should have their locked value set to 1

  - this script checks for local organisations and sets the locked field to 1 for all events not created by them

  - a local organisation, as defined for the scope of this scrips is: an organisation with at least 2 members or an organisation with a single member that is not a sync user.

  - The script is only accessible by site admins and will return a notification about the number of events altered.
- Merge branch 'hotfix-2.1.11' into hotfix-2.1.8. [iglocska]

  appcontroller and saved into a public array, doing a lookup of the
  array saves an SQL call for each permission check.

- Grouped documentation. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Removed warning message. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Update to the attribute search. [iglocska]

  - Use ! to exclude terms in the value/id/org fields

  - org search works the same way as value / id now, you can enter several
  terms separated by a newline. Also, adding ! infront of a term will
  exclude the organisation from the results

  - sub string search for organisations
- Consistency in MYSQL database file. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Unify db schema. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Filter logic reworked. [iglocska]

  - Affects org and info field

  - terms have to be saparated by pipe (|)

  - terms can be terms that will be OR-d or excluded terms that will be
  AND-ed

  - to exclude a term use !

  - A valid filter search for info would be: 'term1|term2|!term3'
  -> this would result in all events with the info field containing term1
  or term2 but not term3
- NOT filter for orgs on the event index. [iglocska]

  - entering for example '!futuremark' would exclude all events created by
  the organisation 'futuremark'

  [iglocska]

  - On the event index, users can view the e-mail address of the event
  creator, if the event belongs to their own organisation

  - siteadmins can now search the creator org instead of the owner org
  (like normal users would)

  - Changed the org search to be a partial match instead of an exact match
- Two small changes. [Iglocska]

  - email of the user creating an event shown if current user's org ==
    event's orgc

  - on export, the check for to_ids will happen outside of the if branch
    that sets extra restrictions of non site admins. Otherwise site-admins
    would accidentally include attributes that aren't iocs.
- Fix to the filters on IE. [Iglocska]

  - old versions of IE didn't handle an incorrect form creation as gracefully as the other browsers

  - forms should not be created within a table unless it's within a <td> (it was
    on <tr> level before). The normal solution would be to encapsulate the
    entire table in a form, but since we have formlinks for the deletes /
    publishes this would get flagged as form tampering by the security
    components.

  - As a fix, filter forms are created separately for the 4 search fields within their <td> now with hidden fields that keep the persistence of the previously
    entered filter terms
- Incorrect line removed from migration. [iglocska]
- Update to the migration. [iglocska]
- First update to the SQL scripts. [iglocska]

  added an e-mail is sent to all subscribing members of the orgc and the
  new field is set to 1
  - Accepting a change resets the field to 0
- Extra access control restriction for reportValidationIssues.

    be handled more gracefully

  - pull is not yet tested

  - attachments and shadow attributes not yet implemented

  - backflow is nicely blocked by the timestamp as intended

  - needs cleanup (from, dist_change)
- Saving over night, something still blocks the timestamp from being
  saved after a push... [iglocska]
- More work on the timestamps. [iglocska]

  - Event correctly changes timestamp when attribute edited in the UI
  - Attribute correctly changes timestamp when edited in the UI

  timestamp, default value 0)
  - timestamps created on add / edit when apprioriate
  - during an add, if an event/attribute is not being pushed through a
  sync with an existing timestamp, create a timestamp
  - on edit, check whether the timestamp is newer than the old one and
  only add the attribute or event then
- Bug with adding an event and the org being set incorrectly. [iglocska]
- Changes to the event filtering. [iglocska]

  - there was a bug that pushed the data entered into the "published"
  filter field to the date fields -> fixed

  - Also a bug in the serverscontroller, pulling threw an undefined
  warning from the log controller because a single saveField was used and
  the logController couldn't save the url data for the action

  - upgrade scripts finish gracefully
- Small change to the migration. [iglocska]
- Change to the migration script fixing an error. [iglocska]

  During the structure export of the ACL tables the current increment count
  from the test environment got left in, caused errors when creating a new
  role.
- Instructions for the upgrade. [iglocska]

  - 1st version
- Update to generateCount. [iglocska]

  - generateCount used to just run through all attributes and save them, to
    generate the count. It led to VERY long execution times on larger
    databases (25k+ attributes). With the extra processing that each save()
    does for attributes, this was horribly slow.

  - new generateCount just saves the events based on the number of
    associated attributes, only having to save the events (of which there
    are considerably less).
- More updates to the migration. [iglocska]
- Slight change to generating the ArosAcos. [iglocska]

    events / attributes and in the search attribute view.

  - Replaced it with values provided by extra cake queries as the delay for
    fetching the info field through a js rest request was annoyingly slow

  - some coding standards
- Attribute and event access. [Andras Iklody]

  - Updated the check for authorisation to view an event and attribute as
    the system hid some valid combinations (such as a server only attribute
    in a higher distribution level event).
- Regexp validation. [Andras Iklody]

  - an invalid regexp entry could block any event/attribute from being
    entered. Introduced a check on regexp entry to block faulty patterns.
- Changes to logs and some minor changes. [Andras Iklody]

  - Regexp, blacklist, roles, whitelists now logged

  - adminCRUD now sets ID (for the logging) on edit

    sanitization isn't needed.
- Tighter checks so users can't edit events of other orgs. [Andras
  Iklody]
- Update to the admin privileges. [Andras Iklody]

  - Changed the requirement for a lot of functions to be site admin as
    opposed to admin.
- Cleanup of some duplicate junk. [Andras Iklody]
- New regular expressions default values. [Andras Iklody]

  - List of new values for the regexp table

  - if the user_id for an event is not set, set it to that of the user with
    the e-mail address of 'cisprotection@ncirc.nato.int'.
- Colouring of search terms works in links. [Andras Iklody]

  - links now have proper colouring to make the found terms more visible
- Some changes to the search. [Andras Iklody]

  - changes to the validation of the results

  - fixes an issue where the escaping of slashes showed up with a //

  - made the found results more visible and case insensitive
- Slight update to the filename regex. [Andras Iklody]

  - accept extensions from 2 to 4 characters in length
- Fixed some regex issues and file name validation. [Andras Iklody]

  - Fixed an issue that caused attribute values to be converted to 1 on
    save in case of an empty regexp table

  - Filename validation now happens via whitelisting instead of filename
    sanitization
- Checkbox / radio misalignment. [Andras Iklody]

  - Fixed an issue with IE interpretting an unset padding value for
    checkboxes / radio selects as a good reason to give it some high value.

  - Fixed a bug with editing attributes
- Still issues with the attribute search. [Andras Iklody]

  - should be ok now
- Fix to the updated search attributes. [Andras Iklody]

  - issue on the live server with the search field left empty, fixed
- Several things (search, migration) [Andras Iklody]

  - Changes to the default setting for non private events after migration

  - search attribute update to be able to exclude events
- Updated the migration script (SQL) [Andras Iklody]

  - Script updated based on the issues during testing

  - Changed the file upload/downoad mechanism.
- Composite type change. [Andras Iklody]

  - composite type's value not exploded if value1 already set (to hopefully
    fix issues with the migration tool)
- Missing migration sql updates. [Andras Iklody]
- Regexp fixed. [Andras Iklody]

  - Regexp replacement didn't actually change the data in the object. Fixed.

  - First version of an SQL upgrade script
- Fixed a minor error. [Andras Iklody]

  - comma at the end of line missing in SQL file
- Changes to the distribution handling of attributes. [Andras Iklody]

  - Only the creating org of the event can change the distribution of
    attributes

  - Attribute distribution setting are only pushed on edits if they were
    manually changed (so that the distribution level of events on the
    creating server doesn't get degraded by an edit and push of the event at
    a synced server when using connected community settings).

  - slight change to the batch attribute search, the search terms are only
    echoed up to 9 terms to prevent the mass echoing of a long list
- Some updates to the migration script. [Andras Iklody]

  - Getting it up to date
- Attribute edit fixed. [Andras Iklody]

  - Editing attributes caused an error because the uuid was not passed back
    from the form (and it is used to find the attribute locally for rest)

  - UUID is now used from the read attribute for non rest users. In the long
    run it would be cleaner to not allow non rest users to reach that part
    of the code.
- Minor changes. [Andras Iklody]

  - some changes to the access control

  - re-renabled regexp and blacklists, will need a closer look though

  - editing a role should update ACL

  - some other minor things
- Previous commit was slightly off. [Andras Iklody]

  Changed the placing of the unset, as it broke the push of attachments.
  Should be fine now.
- Major bug with attributes disappearing during sync. [Andras Iklody]

  Found a bug where an instance that has a lower attribute count pushing to
  another would cause the attributes with equal attribute ID to get
  overwritten with the pushed ones. Unsetting the attribute ID before the
  push fixes this.
- Update to the menu. [Andras Iklody]

  - minor cosmetic change
- Reworked the sync / release control. [Andras Iklody]

  - Fixed issues with the sync
  	- Secondary publishes on remote servers failed
  	- Introduced new fields in events to stop backward traverse of
  	  edit information that lead to low performance and eroneous
  	  distribution information updates when more than 2 servers were
  	  linked
  	- Deletion of an attribute now deletes on remote servers

  - Changes to the event ownership
  	- Original creator org now noted in the event itself
  	- Only original creator org can change distribution
  	- Events will show up with the original creator org for users
  	  (admins can see both that and the owner of the event on the
  	  local instance)
  	- Server.organization now used in junction with the connecting
  	  user's org and the instance's org (from the bootstrap) to

  Subject: Re: sync/REST
  Date: Fri, 7 Dec 2012 13:30:10 +0000
  in this there is a complaint about the RESTfull sync workings.
  the email hints about 2 possible options:
  i) RESTfull add event without attributes (conform the web interface)
  ii) RESTfull add event with attributes (more conform the code)

  both are implemented and can be choisen in bootstrap.php by
  Configure::write('CyDefSIG.rest', 'ii') or 'i'.

  removed No push leftovers as a distribution.
- SQL. [noud]

  pull-up all changes to the db model,
  so MYSQL.txt has all needed for a clean start db.
- Contact reporter. [noud]

  Submit to org button in the contact reporter view – changed it
  to just submit, having the tickbox to contact a person only + the submit
  to org button seems a bit confusing.

- Distribution. [noud]

  border="1"-testleftover removed.
- Distribution. [noud]

  if distribution is All, so not displayed in an index nor in attributes

- Dropdowns. [noud]

  let the risk dropdown in event add and edit behave like the other
  dropdowns.

  if that's correct, that was forgotten in the actions_menu.ctp.

  Add "Pull only" as a sharing state where,
  everybody does see an event, is pullable,
  but will never be pushed.

  Has a generatePrivate for db conversion now.
- Private. [noud]

  Private events are true private and
  running a server in 2 modes (private and sync),
  so real private (red) or private to server (amber)
  or full distributable (green).

  Mind this needs a change to tables events, attributes and correlation.
  These are in MYSQL.private.sql.
- Merge branch 'master' into develop. [noud]
- Blackhole. [noud]

  i have an idea this blackholeCallback seems to overcome a lot of
  blackhole situations we got.
  Notably during deleting multiple events from the index,
  this improved not getting a blackhole a lot.

  If there is a need to change an extern existing plugin,

  the attachment or malware is synced as well.

- Sync. [noud]

  The actual logos used for visable flags in Events::index.
- Sync. [noud]

  Sync worked, but we did not know what to do with user_id and org.
  Now, on sync, anonymize the user_id, get the Server.organization and put
  that into Event.org.
  And, display owning flag if Event.user_id or get the Server.logo
  belonging to Event.org (=Server.organization) when Event.user_id is
  empty (=0).

  To this there is organization name and logo in bootstrap and
  other organizations names and logos in Servers.

- Delete (published) event or attribute. [noud]

  Previous, upon delete only on the local server the event or attribute
  was deleted.
  Now, if delete, look for same event or attribute (using it's uuid)
  and delete on remote servers as well.
  Also look and delete if not published, so no dangling/zombie copies
  remain on remote servers.
- Authkey validation bug and cleanup of fixed bugs list. [noud]
- Authkey validation. [noud]

  An authkey with any length, so less then 40, could be entered.
  Now authkey has to have a length of 40 (or higher).
- HIDS exports sorted (and small indention correction). [noud]
- Whitelist not on NidsExportComponent::urlRule. [noud]

  In hindsight, an url should not be excluded given a host or domain name.
- Correlation speedup using AttributesController i.s.o.
  EventsController. [noud]

  We forgot to change some view things using the right controller.
- REST edit Event implementation. [noud]

  Now after publish, edit and (re)publish an event,
  that event will be updated on the other servers.
- Event.user_id. [noud]

  Event.user_id was re-added but we still missed some,
  so an added event would get user_id set to zero.
  Now Event gets the correct user_id again from
